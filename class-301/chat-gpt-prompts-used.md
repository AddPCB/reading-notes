# Prompts for generating reading notes

Below are the prompts I used to generate my class notes using Chat GPT 3 Pro.

I add markdown formatting and clean the language in the titles, but it is functionally Chat GPT 3's Output.

I postulate that using Chat GPT in this way is right and valid, but -ONLY- when the generation prompts are included with the output.

I believe this is the open hand philosophy that open soruce development demands, and that showing your prompts is an essential part of publishing any work done with Chat GPT.

During this project I will endeavour to catalogue my use of Chat GPT, and through this prove it's utility to students who are poor note-takers.
