# Chat GPT generated Code 301 reading notes

These notes have been generated from the class README.md files using Chat GPT 3 Pro.

I add markdown formatting, and clean the language in the titles, but the notes are functionally Chat GPT 3's Output.

I believe documenting generation prompts and processes is the right way to keep a transparent authorship record of generated content.

I believe that publishing this prompt engineering documentation sanitises generated output for integration into an open source development workflow.

I believe that GPT output sanitised and documented this way contains enough attribution to become as valid a commit as any other that includes reference text or code.

During this project I will endeavour to catalogue my use of Chat GPT, and through this prove it's utility to students like me who are poor note-takers.
